# Pinball Game in Logisim

Welcome to the Pinball Game project in Logisim! This is a digital implementation of a classic pinball game using the Logisim circuit simulation tool and CDM8 processor. In this README, you will find an overview of the project, instructions for running the simulation, and details about the game's features.

## Overview
The Pinball Game project aims to recreate the excitement of a traditional pinball game using Logisim, a digital logic simulator. The project involves designing and implementing various circuits that simulate the behavior of a pinball machine. 

## Running the Simulation
To run the Pinball Game simulation, follow these steps:

1. Install Logisim: Download and install Logisim from the official website (https://www.cburch.com/logisim/).

2. Clone the Repository: Clone the Pinball Game repository to your local machine using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/RomchikkF/Digital-Platforms-Project.git`

3. Open the Project: Launch Logisim and open the `pinball.circ` file located in the cloned repository.

4. Start the Simulation: Click on the "Simulate" button in the Logisim toolbar to start the simulation.

5. Use LOAD GAME button to allow CDM8 to load game level map.

6. Interact with the Pinball Machine: Use the provided input devices to control the doors and launch the ball. Observe the ball's movement, interact with different game elements, and aim for high scores!

## Game Features
The Pinball Game project includes the following features:

1. **Doors**: Control the doors using input devices (2 buttons under the screen) to hit the ball and change its trajectory.

2. **Collision Detection**: Detect collisions between the ball and various game elements, such as walls and doors. This allows for realistic ball movement and interaction with the playfield.

3. **Ball Physics**: Experience realistic ball physics, including gravity and bouncing off walls and game elements.

4. **Score Tracking**: Track your score as you play the game. Score points by hitting walls and doors.

## Contributing
